<h4>Crossroads-Group</h4>
<h6>Take-Home Project<h6>

<h5>Objective</h5>

<p>
The goal of this project will be to create a web application that shows git commit history for the project youâ€™re working on (looks a lot like recursion, huh?). You need to make many well-stated commits while working on this project and regularly push them up.
</p>
<p>
You will need to sign up for a free GitHub account if you do not already have one, then create a public repository to store your work so that we will be able to see and review it. You can find documentation on the GitHub API here: https://developer.github.com/v3/.
</p>
<p>
You can use the Angular, Vue, or React framework. We are currently looking for candidates that know Angular or TypeScript.
</p>

<h5>Requirements</h5>

<p>
You must use the GitHub API - while you could make a scraper or devise another method to get the git commit history of your project, we would like to see how you work with an existing API.
</p>
<p>
Your GitHub repository must be public - this will allow us to look at it and verify the accuracy of your code. Once you complete this project, you will need to send over the link to your project to us with the email address provided below.
The style of the page is up to you. Typically we use something like Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) for a lot of our projects, then style it to meet the business want or need later on.
</p>

<strong>
You MUST provide instructions in the README on how to install and run your project. We will not infer anything, and if you do not include these instructions, we will reject your submission.
